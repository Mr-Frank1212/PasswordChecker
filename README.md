# Password Checker

This program is designed to enhance password security awareness by evaluating the integrity of user-provided passwords. It accepts multiple password inputs as command-line arguments and checks each one against a publicly available database of compromised credentials, such as the "Have I Been Pwned" API.

For each password, the program determines whether it has appeared in known data breaches and, if so, reports the number of times it has been compromised. This information allows users to make more informed decisions about their password choices and helps promote better cybersecurity practices.

By automating the process of checking for password vulnerabilities, the program serves as a useful tool for both individuals and organizations aiming to audit password strength and reduce the risk of account compromise.
